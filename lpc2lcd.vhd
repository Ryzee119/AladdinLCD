-- This VHDL code was written to replace the CPLD logic on the cheap AladdinXT 4032 Original Xbox modchip.
-- It converts the modchip to a basic LCD driver, consequently it looses the ability to load a custom bios.
-- This is best used with a TSOP modded or soft modded console.
--
-- The Lattice LC4032V CPLD on the cheap alladin modchips is extremely limited, so this code is a hacky bare minimim
-- to reduce macrocell usage to fit onto the CPLD. Therefore it will not support any other
-- functionality, unless you decide to migrate it to a higher macrocell count CPLD (i.e 4064 variant)
--
-- This does not support adjusting the backlight via the dashboard settings
-- This has very limited contrast control through the dashboard settings. It couldnt even manage an 8-bit PWM signal.
-- For the dashboard settings: 0%=No Contrast, 25%=Full Constrast. Anything else wont work as expected.
-- If this isn't good enough for your particular LCD, use an external trimmer.
